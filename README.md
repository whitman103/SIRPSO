# An actively developed C++ code which implements a basic particle swarm optimization routine on a distributed computing node (SLURM) in order to deduce parameters in an ultrasensitive signaling network, meant to resemble NK cell CYTOK data.
This work is written to fulfill an NIH grant with Nationwide Children's Hospital under Dr. Jayajit Das. 
## Program written in C++, data analysis and visualization in R, Mathematica used for secondary modeling (not in current repository, has been deprecated for C++ verification instead)
